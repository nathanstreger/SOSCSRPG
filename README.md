# my-first-rpg
This project followed Scott Lilly's tutorial on learning C# by building a simple RPG game. The purpose here was not to create an amazing game, but to learn industry standard design techniques for OOP, like Publish/Subscribe patterns and such. I added several things of my own and have tried to include all of my contributions in the Readme file.

In order to run this on a clone in Visual Studios, it must on a Window's operating system.
